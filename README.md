# Process-Scheduling
This project simulates the execution of processes in single CPU system that implements the Round Robin Scheduler.

Each process has different 
* arrival times
* service times

which is given in text file.

These processes are simulated for different:
* overhead time
* turnaround time

At the end of the simulation, **the total time of simulation, average wait time for each process, average length of the waiting
queue** is calculated.
